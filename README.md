# Assignment 1
## GAM531 - Game Engine Foundations 

I have used the **OpenTK** library since the goal of the assignment was to render a 2D rectangle in an OpenGL Window, which can only be done using this library. The SharpDX library is used to work with DirectX.

## How to run the project

1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Divyesh-Bhanvadiya/GAM531-Assignment-1.git
```
2. Open in the IDE of your choice and install `OpenTK (4.9.4)` as a dependency.
3. Build and run the project.
